Hey there!

This started out as a simple project to parse and display time according to the
RFC 3339, but with time i felt the necessity to add one more RFC, and now im
not sure where/when this will end.

So, some latest changes:
- Added initial support for RFC 2822

TODO:
- Get rid of Haskell "formatTime" function, and use a more decent pretty
  printing lib
- Do some proper parsing (it parses nicely, but this was just a quick hack
  that my mind produced while being stressed to finish this)
